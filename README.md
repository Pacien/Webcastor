Webcastor
=========

Webcastor is a simple websocket broadcaster based on socket.io and node.js.

When a broadcaster sends a message to a channel, it is broadcast to all other clients (including other broadcasters) connected to the channel.

Channels are created with a generated ID and an optional broadcaster password.

This application is currently running on [https://webcastor.herokuapp.com/](https://webcastor.herokuapp.com/).
